# Gaming Console Shop
This is an app concept that I made just for practicng.

The App idea is for selling the new gaming console generation.

I got inspired when I saw a beatiful app design in Dribbble, made by <b>Shashank Kaushik</b>, so i decided to built it in Flutter.

Here is the design reference -> https://dribbble.com/shots/14588621-Gaming-Console-Shop
